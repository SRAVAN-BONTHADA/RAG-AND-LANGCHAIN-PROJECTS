# **RAG Examples with Pinecone and Qdrant**

This repository contains implementations of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using two different vector databases: **Pinecone** and **Qdrant**. RAG is an advanced approach that integrates information retrieval with generative AI models, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Files in the Repository**
1. **`Pinecone_Rag.ipynb`**  
   - Implementation of RAG using the Pinecone vector database.
   - Demonstrates how to index and query documents for enhanced information retrieval.
   
2. **`Rag_With_Qdrant_Mama.ipynb`**  
   - Implementation of RAG using the Qdrant vector database.
   - Focuses on building scalable, high-performance retrieval-based systems.

### **Key Features**
- Integration with Hugging Face models for generative capabilities.
- Step-by-step explanation for setting up Pinecone and Qdrant.
- Query-based generation using document embeddings for better contextual accuracy.

## **Requirements**

To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

### **Python Libraries**
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `pinecone-client`
- `qdrant-client`
- `torch`
- `faiss` (optional for local vector searches)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

### **API Keys**
- Pinecone API key (for `Pinecone_Rag.ipynb`).
- Qdrant setup (for `Rag_Mama.ipynb`).

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SRAVAN-BONTHADA/RAG-EXAMPLES-WITH-PINECONE-AND-QDRANT.git
   cd RAG-EXAMPLES-WITH-PINECONE-AND-QDRANT
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets pinecone-client qdrant-client torch numpy pandas
   ```

3. Set up API keys:
   - For Pinecone: Get an API key from [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) and set it up in the notebook.
   - For Qdrant: Follow the instructions at [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) to initialize the database.

---

## **How to Use**

1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Load:
   - **`Pinecone_Rag.ipynb`** to work with Pinecone.
   - **`Rag_Mama.ipynb`** to work with Qdrant.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in each notebook.

---

## **Results**
- **Pinecone**: Efficient document retrieval and integration with Hugging Face models for generating accurate responses.  
- **Qdrant**: High-performance vector search and RAG capabilities for real-time applications.
